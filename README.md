# Do you think you are paid fairly? An analysis of factors that affect annual salary

## Project Objective
Humans spend a third of their waking time working, yet the role of our job in our lives is usually underappreciated. When it comes to work, there are many output variables that one might consider before choosing to stick to: job satisfaction, number of hours, working environment, benefits, and most importantly, pay. Since one’s salary is so detrimental to his well-being, we seek to understand the factors that contribute to this number. Does one simply get paid more if he or she works harder and more efficiently? In other words, how much do skills and experiences really affect one’s income? Moreover, are there other variables, especially ones that do not contribute to skills such as race and gender, that affect wage as well, and to what extent? On the basis that the workplace and recruitment process should be
merit-based, we hope to find that skills and experiences would dictate salaries more than other variables. However, in the case that it is not, we will propose some solutions for future studies on the matter.
